# Battleship Game

The machine will automatically place the boats on a board of 10x10, and the user has to write movements with a format such as A5, B2, H4... (it is case insensitive, and considers A0 like A1).

First of all get all packages:
`$ npm install`

To watch while you are developing  (the compiled code goes to the `.tmp` directory):
`$ grunt watch`

To run all tests:
`$ grunt test`

To build the project (the result goes to the `dist` directory):
`$ grunt build`
